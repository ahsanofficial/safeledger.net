      "Description": "The process of registering your business with the government as a production and sales entity is known as VAT registration. Once a company registers for VAT, it can recover any VAT it paid on purchases made on behalf of the firm and is accountable for charging the appropriate amount of VAT on all sold products and services along with paying HMRC any VAT which is applicable. A distinct VAT registration number (VRN) will be given to businesses that have registered for VAT. You should put this number on all sales invoices that your company issues."
