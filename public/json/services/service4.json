      "Description": "If your business is not operating at the moment and you do not have any additional revenue streams, such as investment income, it can be deemed Dormant. There are various actions and inactions that should be taken to maintain a company's inactive status. There are various reasons why a business might be inactive, including a business may go dormant right after it is founded or an already-existing trade corporation may go dormant. However, depending on whose perspective you are looking from, the word 'dormant' can indicate different things. For corporation tax reasons, a firm might be considered dormant, although it might not fit Companies House's more stringent definition."
